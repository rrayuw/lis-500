            <h3>Championing Representation</h3>
            <p>
                As a Black woman in tech, Kpatrick leverages her platform to amplify representation.
                At Intuit Mailchimp’s Atlanta office, she thrives in an environment where Black leadership is prioritized.
                For example, three subsequent levels of management are led by Black women.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kpatrick actively engages in employee resource groups (ERGs) for people of color and attends conferences
                like AFROTECH to advocate for visibility in an industry where Black professionals remain underrepresented.

            <h3>Advocating Accessible Pathways</h3>
            <p>
                Now a mentor herself, Kpatrick promotes apprenticeship programs to reduce reliance on costly boot camps or degrees.
                She also encourages freelancing or targeting non-tech companies for entry-level roles.
            </p>
            <p>
                She guides others, stressing the importance of self-advocacy and portfolio-building.
                Her work on Mailchimp’s analytics tools, which empower small businesses to track marketing performance, directly supports economic equity for underrepresented entrepreneurs.

            <p>Ethan Tu was once a reasearcher and developer in AI for Microsoft.</p>

        <div class = "section-box">
            <h3>Developing a Different Kind of AI</h3>
            <p>Instead of creating another version of ChatGPT, he and his team at Taiwan AI Labs decided to be different. They would develop an AI model that better suited the needs of Taiwan, one that focused on healthcare, smart city, and human interaction.</p>
            <p>Due to the rising pandemic of COVID-19 at the time, the lab developed and used the AI to detect COVID-19 in chest X-rays, as well as drug screening and building genome sequencing platform.</p>
            <p>Along with the use in healthcare, the labs AI, "Yating", can also detect fake news and identify the original source.</p>

            <h3>Representing a Nation</h3>
            <p>As a Taiwanese, Ethan has not only helped so many, but he has also inspired many people both in the US as well as Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He has advocated for the combination of Taiwan technology advatage and applying it to the US market's big data to many young Taiwanese engineers.</p>
            <p>Along with the US, he firmly believes he can change the industry in Taiwan as he wants to be a model for others to flip the software industry in Taiwan to something that can foster an environment to grow talent.</p>
