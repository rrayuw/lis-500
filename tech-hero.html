            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Dishanta Kpatrick exemplifies leadership in advancing equity for marginalized groups in tech</p>

            <h3>Championing Representation</h3>
            <p>
                As a Black woman in tech, Kpatrick leverages her platform to amplify representation.
                At Intuit Mailchimp’s Atlanta office, she thrives in an environment where Black leadership is prioritized.
                For example, three subsequent levels of management are led by Black women.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kpatrick actively engages in employee resource groups (ERGs) for people of color and attends conferences
                like AFROTECH to advocate for visibility in an industry where Black professionals remain underrepresented.

        <div class="bio-section">
            <h3>Advocating Accessible Pathways</h3>
            <p>
                Now a mentor herself, Kpatrick promotes apprenticeship programs to reduce reliance on costly boot camps or degrees.
                She also encourages freelancing or targeting non-tech companies for entry-level roles.
            </p>
            <p>
                She guides others, stressing the importance of self-advocacy and portfolio-building.
                Her work on Mailchimp’s analytics tools, which empower small businesses to track marketing performance, directly supports economic equity for underrepresented entrepreneurs.
