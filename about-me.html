                    Hello, I am a junior majoring in Computer Science. Some of my interests are coding, watching movies/shows,
                    watching sports (football and basketball), and hanging out with friends. I took this class because
                    I wanted to learn how tech and media shape our views on race and gender. And also build websites.
                    My favorite "tech" thing would be open source software because itâ€™s all about collaboration and
                    empowering people to build and share freely. Furthermore, a tech hero who inspires me is Linus
                    Torvalds, creator of Linux and Git who basically revolutionized open source software.

                    Hello! My name is Marvel, I am currently a senior studying Data Science and Information Science.
                    Some hobbies I enjoy are tennis, basketball, piano, lifting, bouldering, and hanging out with friends.
                    I took this class because I wanted to not only improve my skills in web development, but I also wanted
                    to challenge and expand upon my self-perception on race and gender.
