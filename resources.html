            <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
            <p>
                Implicit bias represents the stereotypes, unconscious feelings, and mental associations
                we have built and developed throughout our lives regarding different social groups.
            </p>
            <h3>Take the Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</h3>
            <p>
                This reports your attitudes or beliefs about various topics and give you some information about yourself
                (Project Implicit).
                In particular, it measures hidden preferences and attitudes you may have, often without realizing it,
                toward certain groups based on race, gender, or other traits.

            <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
            <p>
                Intersectionality is about how different kinds of discrimination, like racism, sexism, or
                classism, can overlap and affect people in unique ways. It looks at how these factors combine
                to shape one’s experiences.

                        Ben Shapiro
                    </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                DiAngelo sees intersectionality as a framework for different forms of privilege and oppression
                interacting and using it to examine racial dynamics. She uses individual experiences and examines how
                those fit in a broader pattern of privilege. Additionally, she views the coalition building as a step
                to understand shared struggles while acknowledging differences between people. In regard to power dynamics,
                she examines the advantages and disadvantages operating and how deeply white privilege and racism is
                embedded in society.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shapiro sees intersectionality as a hierarchy of whose opinion matters more where victimhood is used to
                determine rank in hierarchy. He argues intersectionality negates individual identity and instead
                focuses on shared victim status. Furthermore, he views the coalition building as only coming together
                through identity rather than shared experience creating “us vs them” mindset. Thus, Shapiro views the
                power dynamics as a simple way for these victim groups to attack “straight, white males”
            </p>
            <h3>Our takeaway</h3>
            <p>
                Intersectionality helps explain overlapping discrimination, but can be divisive if misused.
                Ultimately, it’s a tool for understanding privilege, not a rigid ideology. The viewpoints
                show a tension between systemic analysis and individual agency.
